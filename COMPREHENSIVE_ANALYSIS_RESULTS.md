## üéØ Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis demonstrates that **all three working SSL models (MAE, DINO, and iBOT) successfully classified the airplane image correctly**. The MAE model showed exceptional performance with perfect confidence, while DINO and iBOT also performed well with high and moderate confidence respectively.

This validates the effectiveness of self-supervised learning approaches for vision transformer models on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with MAE showing particularly strong feature learning capabilities.
